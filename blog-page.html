            Why be Vegan?
          </h2>
          <h4>
            Feb 11, 2020 by Emily Ann Jess
          </h4>
          <p>
            While 750 million people go to bed hungry every night,
            one-third of the world’s grain is fed to farmed animals.
            A typical Western meat-based diet can only feed 2.5 billion
            people; a plant-based diet will feed every one of us.
            90 per cent of the UK's animal feed protein concentrates come
            from poor countries – often those where children die from starvation.
            Eating meat and dairy foods is not the only reason for world hunger
            but it is a major contributor. We must drastically change our eating
            habits if we are to feed the world adequately. People go hungry while
            ever increasing numbers of animals are fed huge amounts of food in a
            hopelessly inefficient system.

          Every year in Britain, over a billion animals face
          slaughter having spent their short lives in confinement,
          pain and misery. The growing demand for cheap meat,
          dairy and eggs has led to a drop in welfare standards
          as factory-farming methods intensify. Chickens crammed
          into sheds with no room for compassion, mothering sows
          routinely caged to deliver and feed and zero-grazing cows
          that never see grass. Organic and free-range alternatives
          are not much better, and they all end up being slaughtered
          for food. Turning vegan means you’re no longer a part of
          that cycle of death.

          Compared to meat-eaters, vegans weigh less, have lower
          cholesterol, blood pressure and rates of type 2 diabetes.
          They have a 30 per cent lower risk of heart disease and
          lower cancer rates. Most cases of heart disease, type 2 diabetes
          and a third of cancers can be avoided by changing to a healthier
          diet, increasing physical activity and stopping smoking.
          We don't need saturated fat, animal protein or cholesterol.
          We don’t need trans fatty acids in processed foods or salt and
          sugar in their current quantities. We do need to move towards a
          plant-based, whole food diet containing a wide range of fruits,
          vegetables, grains, pulses, nuts and seeds for the nutrients that
          promote a long and healthy life and protect against disease.
          <q>
            The same diet that is good for preventing cancer is also good
            for preventing heart disease, obesity, diabetes and so on.
            Changing your diet can have an enormous impact on health –
            for better or worse!

        <h4><mark>Healthy Vegan Recipes</mark></h4>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Tbs olive oil</li>
          <li>2 Tbs fresh thyme leaves</li>
          <li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
          <li>1/2 brown onion, finely chopped (optional leave out if fructose sensitive)</li>
          <li>2 -4 cloves of garlic (depending on how much of a garlic fiend you are)</li>
          <li>750g mushrooms (I used a mix of cup, button and swiss brown mushrooms), finely sliced</li>
          <li>1 x 400g can cannelini beans</li>
          <li>1 litre vegetable stock</li>
          <li>1 tsp white pepper</li>
          <li>more olive oil, black pepper and thyme to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Directions</p>

        Set aside 2/3 cup of the mushrooms, these will be a garnish).
        Put a large pot on medium heat and add the olive oil and onion if using.
        Cook until translucent and soft then add thyme, garlic and parsley and cook
        for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and stir for a few minutes to mix everything through.
        Continue to cook the mushrooms and herbs for 5 minutes.
        Add the chicken stock and 500ml hot water at this point and bring to a boil.
        Add the cannelini beans (drained and rinsed) and simmer for 15 minutes.
        Meanwhile, cook the reserved mushrooms in a small pan over meidum heat with a
        little olive oil and a sprinkle of thyme. You want these mushrooms to be golden.
        Once they are golden take off the heat and set aside.
        Use a blender or stick blender to process the soup to a creamy puree.
        Serve the soup garnished with some of the browned mushrooms,
        some thyme leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Crusty bread is aso
        delicious!

        <h4><mark>Dessert recipe</mark></h4>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups unsweetened desiccated coconut (finely shredded)</li>
          <li>1/2 cup creamy nut butter (i.e. cashew butter, peanut butter*, or almond butter)</li>
          <li>1/4 cup melted cocoa butter.</li>
          <li>1/3 cup cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
          <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
          <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
          <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>2-3 whole fresh pitted dates* (chopped // medjool is best // or sub more maple syrup)</li>
          <li>3 Tbsp cacao nibs for topping (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Directions</p>
        Line a standard 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside
        (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size).
        Add coconut to a food processor and mix until a creamy "butter" or
        liquidy paste is formed - about 4 minutes - scraping down sides as needed.
        Next, add nut butter, melted cocoa butter, cacao powder, maple syrup, sea
        salt, and vanilla. Mix until thoroughly combined, scraping down sides as
        needed. Lastly, add chopped (pitted) dates and mix once more to combine.
        Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more vanilla for vanilla flavor,
        cacao powder for chocolate flavor, maple syrup for sweetness, or nut butter
        for nuttiness. If the mixture appears too thick, simply thin with a bit more
        maple syrup or melted cocoa butter! It should be semi-thick but pourable
        (see photo). Transfer the mixture to the parchment-lined loaf pan and spread
        into an even layer. Then top with cacao nibs (optional). Loosely cover with
        plastic wrap or another sheet of parchment paper and freeze until firm to the
        touch - about 15-20 minutes.Remove from freezer and cut into 21 even squares
        (or desired number // amount as original recipe is written). Enjoy immediately.
        Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month.
        Best enjoyed at room temperature.
